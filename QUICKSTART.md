## Step 1: Restart Your Terminal

Since you just installed Node.js, you need to **close and reopen** your PowerShell/Terminal window for it to recognize npm commands.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd C:\Users\atyre\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\midsouthdumpsterms

This will install all Next.js dependencies (may take 2-3 minutes).

## Step 3: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

You'll see your new website running locally!
